# Stop-watch
A stopwatch is a tool used to measure how much time has passed from the moment you start it to the moment you stop it.
The stopwatch lets you start, stop, and reset the time.
Time is shown in this format: HH:MM:SS (like 00:05:12).

"HTML creates the layout:"
<br>
A title ("Stopwatch")
<br>
A time display
<br>
Three buttons (Start, Stop, Reset)
<br>
CSS makes it look clean:
<br>
Centers everything
<br>
Adds button colors (green, red, blue)
<br>
Makes the display big and bold
<br>
JavaScript adds the working logic:
<br>
start() begins counting every second
<br>
stop() pauses the stopwatch
<br>
reset() stops and sets the time back to zero
<br>
Time is updated on the screen in real time
